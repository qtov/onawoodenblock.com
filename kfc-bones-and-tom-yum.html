</footer><!-- /.post-info --> <p>So... Friday I had a strong desire for KFC. I went on foodpanda (cause Tazz doesn't have it) and looked to see which can get me the best deal for my money.</p>
<ul>
<li>80 ron for Giant Bucket, ~670g of meat, ~480g of potatoes. eh... potatoes are cheap, I can fry myself, I have around 2-3kgs of fresh potatoes.</li>
<li>47.5 ron for American Bucket, ~550g of meat (11 crispy, 11 wings).</li>
<li>36.5 ron for Hot Bucket, ~400g of meat (20 wings).</li>
</ul>
<p>The American Bucket is the best choice, 0.086 ron for gram of meat, compared to Hot Bucket which is 0.091 ron for gram of meat (and all of them are wings, so I'd pay for bones as well). I'm a cheap person, I usually buy only when heavily discounted, I can barely afford to order once a week, so better make the best out of it, lol.</p>
<p>Anyways, I bought 2 American Buckets, I need meat, I don't want to pay transport fees twice. I put the order, and I instantly started preparing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dklh4oKifVQ">french fries</a>.
10 minutes boil in water with vinegar, take them out, shove them in my wok with oil, and fry them ONCE, nobody has the time to fry them twice when the bucket is on the table.</p>
<p>Came out crispy af, better than kfc can ever make. Chicken was ok, but soggy, nothing to expect from kfc delivery. It steams in there for a while, and until the driver arrives it can take its sweet time in that sauna.</p>
<p>I was satisfied nonetheless. With a lot of meat, comes a lot of bones, should I simply throw them away?
Absolutely not, put them in a pot with water and simmer that for around 1 hour, until I got bored and let it cool. Put it in a container and in the fridge it went.</p>
<p>Today (Sunday) I remembered I have that stock in the fridge, took it out, put it in a pot, brought it to boil, put a big spoon of Tom Yum paste (which you can find at TasteOfAsia or <a href="https://iwok.ro/produs/pasta-iute-acrisoara-tom-yum-thai-454-g/">iwok</a>).
Made some noodles, blanched some kale (had some from ColinaFarms), boiled some eggs, cut some green onions, done.</p>
<p>I enjoyed an easy soup without too much hassle. I really recommend something like that, it's a paste that stays in the fridge for months (mine is in the fridge for over 16 months). I haven't died yet, had no problems, has a shit ton of salt so it's preserved quite well. Also, IF you ever make such a soup or ramen, I definitely recommend blanching some leafy greens like kale, spinach or lettuce, it definitely adds a lot of texture.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, what I also ate today was some chicken in the oven with some herb mix and a side of butter sauteed kale. Nothing too fancy, but it did its job. The bones were put in the fridge to make tomorrow another chicken stock, I'm not wasting them.</p>
<p>Also, as to why I put Colinafarms if I'm such a cheap person? I make questionable choices.</p>
<p>See ya!</p>
