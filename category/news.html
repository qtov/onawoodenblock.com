<p>I live in Cluj-Napoca (for now) and probably will move to Debrecen in the next couple of months. I'm not sure though, we'll see.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a blog, so yeah, this is it.
It'll contain food reviews (mostly orders, cause I don't really leave my house), cooking, coding, and whatever I feel the need to write about.</p>
<p>My hobbies are: cooking, food, tea, ceramics (I make), k-drama, anime, music, VERY casual gaming, +/- a few others.
I wish I'd add travelling, but I'm poor af, can't afford it for now, might be able to later on. I very much want to travel to Korea, Japan, China to try some asian street food, that's what life is for, asian street food.</p>
<p>Currently working in an IT position for 3 years (at the date of writing this).</p>
<p>I have a lot of bashing to do for some places in Cluj, so I'm doing this to immortalize the money loss that occured from ordering from them.</p>
<p>I'm writing it in English because I like English, and it offers the possibility for the hundreds of thousands of people awaiting to read my blog to actually be able to.</p>
<p>I hope you'll like it, see ya!</p>                </article>
