<p>I live in Cluj-Napoca.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a blog, so I made it.
I'll put food reviews (mostly orders, cause I don't really leave my house), cooking, coding, ceramics, and whatever I feel the need to write about.</p>
<p>My dream is, making cups, literally. I aim high.
I actually make my own tea cups and so, I'd like to put them all here one day.
The aestetic that I'm going towards is wabi-sabi, all my cups need a touch of irregularity, imperfection and rawness.</p>
<p>I don't own a kiln or studio yet, I'm just visiting a workshop once a week maximum, and now I won't be able to until August because of some works in the area.
But I do want and will have a kiln and a place to enjoy creating beauties to no end.</p>
<p>Later, I might open an online shop for cups, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>I work as a Software Engineer so there'll be a category dedicated to coding and stuff, depends if I find anything interesting enough to write and nobody has already written about it, because coding blogs are quite a few.</p>
<p>I'm writing it in English because I like English, and it offers the possibility for the hundreds of thousands of people awaiting to read my blog to actually be able to.</p>
<p>Well, that's it, see ya.</p>                </article>
