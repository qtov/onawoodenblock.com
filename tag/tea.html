</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Throughout my life, the only thing I knew about tea was that green tea is for losing weight and black tea is bitter.<br/>
My mom told me those things, and the only tea we'd ever drink was mint tea with a ton of lemon and honey. Nowadays, thinking back, it was kind of a hot lemonade.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I used to watch TV with my dad and from time to time there would be some Chinese movie where they'd drink tea. I liked the idea and look of it, but never put more thought into it.</p>
<p>Somewhere in highschool I watched an anime called <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji">Kuroshitsuji</a> and there was a scene where the master asks for tea from his butler, but not any tea, it was Earl Grey.<br/>
The butler goes in the basement, brings the tea and makes him a cup. Mind you, I have NEVER heard even once, the name of the tea. I never had any tangency with the subject of tea except from what I wrote above.</p>
<p>I was thrilled, I have to try this I thought... But can I even find it in Romania? And how expensive such a thing can be? The name is posh af.</p>
<p>In the not so distant future, I went to Kaufland with my mom in search of Earl Grey, it doesn't hurt to give it a shot, might actually find it in the supermarket.<br/>
Found the tea section and there it was... <a href="/images/dukat_earl_grey.webp">Dukat Earl Grey</a> teabags, 2-3 ron.</p>
<p>What?! So cheap? I was both happy and scared, overly cheap things surely compromise a lot on quality.</p>
<p>I went home and was still excited to try it. My mom told me to be careful because it's bitter.<br/>
Of course that didn't stop me.
I boiled some water, put the teabag and waited 3 minutes (that's what was written on the box).</p>
<p>After the long awaited time, I gave it a sip. Wasn't anything spectacular, a tad bit bitter, not too much taste.<br/>
What if I add some sugar? I put 1-2 teaspoons of sugar and tried it again... WOAH! Fell in love with it.</p>
<p>A few months pass, I become increasingly more into tea (with sugar) and buy almost every type of tea from the supermarkets to try it out.<br/>
Lipton, Twinnings, Dukat, Taylors of Harrogate and all those big/little brands, I've tried quite a number, I liked them. I tried senchas, Earl Grey, Lady Grey, Breakfast Tea, gunpowder, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Around the 12th grade (last year of highschool) I met somebody on the internet, on a site for anime quotes. He was looking for people to help with the coding of the site. php, HTML and CSS, the things I had to learn that year. I thought it would be a good learning experience.</p>
<p>Talking/playing/coding for a few months with him, we became good friends, and I found out that he drinks tea as well, but only thyme tea.<br/>
In the past I used to want to like the things the people I looked up to liked. And because I looked up to this person, tea became an even more important part of my life.</p>
<p>Highschool ends and here comes university.</p>
<p>I reach a time where I drink a few cups per day while working on projects and staying in front of my laptop.<br/>
I think to myself, I love tea, but if I have each cup with one to two teaspoons of sugar per day, it won't do well for me later on. So I completely remove the sugar, and surprisingly, I enjoy it. I grew to yearn for the bitter flavors of it. </p>
<p>My journey of collecting and trying out new teas does not stop. Months pass, I have a full cabinet worth of teas. Mostly teabags.</p>
<p>Wanting to learn more about the types of tea and how they are made, I stumble on a Youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaHBABJFMRAtnKhQp2Cu5BQ">Meileaf</a>, and on their video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUuw5rqWkZU">The 6 Types Of Tea</a>. I watch more of their videos and find out about a thing called "Gong Fu Tea", and I want to try it very much. They also have made me become a purist, back then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fZclzJUhYg">this video</a> didn't exist, but it's exactly the message I got from a lot of their videos.<br/>
It was around that time that my girlfriend moved from Hungary to Romania to live with me and started working at Demmers in Cluj.<br/>
Because of Demmers I had the chance to try good loose leaf tea, and not the prepackaged, stale, old (not in a good way) teas from supermarkets. For that, I thank them.<br/>
From them also, I bought my first gaiwan, a simple white porcelain, and so I had the chance to try gong-fu, from that moment on Western style tea disappeared from my life.</p>
<p>This was not enough, I wanted more. What if Demmers is not the gold standard of teas, what if there are better teas out there? I can't just blindly accept that I have found the end of my tea journey.</p>
<p>Fortunately it was not the end, <a href="https://white2tea.com/">white2tea</a>, <a href="https://yunnansourcing.com/">Yunnan Sourcing</a> (when they used to ship to Romania, last time I looked they didn't anymore), <a href="https://nioteas.com/">NioTeas</a>, <a href="https://www.hibiki-an.com/">Hibiki-an</a>, <a href="https://eco-cha.com/">eco-cha</a> and the list goes on and on.<br/>
Don't get me wrong though, Demmers doesn't have bad teas. They're affordable and you can find them in Cluj. And if your life doesn't depend on tea, they're a very good choice.<br/>
But if you're like me and life literally revolves around tea, it's not the end goal</p>
<p>A very good book that thought me a lot about teas was <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Tea-Kevin-Gascoyne/9780228100270">Tea: History, Terroirs, Varieties</a>. I also linked my favourite site to buy books from, free worldwide delivery, they're a life saver.</p>
<p>Of course, my journey has not ended, I have to personally go to those countries, and try the teas, brewed in their local spring waters, freshly picked, freshly roasted, take part of the process, learn more and more.</p>
<p>Because tea was such an important thing in my life, I started collecting teaware, gaiwans, cups, teapots.<br/>
So, one day, I was looking for movies/series/anime about tea, and I found it: <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/9996/Hyouge_Mono">Hyouge Mono</a>. It's an anime with tea, but the main focus is teaware. I was thrilled by how they described teaware.<br/>
What if... I make my own? I have a profound connection with tea, why shouldn't I share the connection with teaware?</p>
<p>And so, after a few weeks of looking, researching, I found a ceramic workshop in Cluj. I gathered my courage and paid a visit. I instantly became a regular.<br/>
My first cup (I'll talk about it in a later post) was a success in my opinion, and so I made cups over cups over cups. With that, I've found my purpose in life.<br/>
That after I die, I leave a few pieces of teaware that somebody will put his hands on and say "that's beautiful".
That's what I want to leave behind, beauty in the form of a teacup.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can go to the workshop only once a week, and now because of some works around the area I can't go until the end of August. That is way too little, it's not remotely enough to even have dreams, yet alone, achieve them. I want to spend tens of years, hours a day, practicing. That's the only way it can ever be good enough.</p>
<p>And so, the end goal is, a studio of my own where I can spend hours a day, and a kiln. And who knows, probably a teashop where people can enjoy drinking from my cups.<br/>
It will take quite a few years to achieve my dream, but it's a clear path.</p>
<p>I hope it was a good read, see ya!</p> </article>
