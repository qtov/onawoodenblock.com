</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>So, today I was like, "let's do a little order for milk and stuff" and kaufland on foodpanda had the lowest delivery cost for that, 9 ron.</p>
<p>Last month it used to be free delivery so I have a little bit of experience with them.<br/>
My 3 packs of "PARBOILED" long grain rice became simple long grain rice, things that don't exist, don't exist, and they won't even tell you that, you can't buy less than 1kg of meat or any other vegetable (why? because there's not way to select or even write in any note).</p>
<p>So, because I was cheap, because it was 11 ron cheaper than Bringo (and I didn't want to spend more than 100 ron, whereas when I order bringo at least 50 ron is spent on promotions if I don't want to pay the delivery fee), I was like, they can't fuck it up today as well, can they?</p>
<p>They didn't, fortunately, but the SPECIFIC items that don't exist, don't exist. I'm left without my salad and spring onions... sad.</p>
<p>If I ordered through Bringo they would've nicely called me and said "Hey mate, we did not spring onions and lettuce" and then they would've told me what they replaced them with and if I want any more replacements or if I'm ok with what they did.<br/>
I could've replaced my spring onions with a leek and that exact lettuce with some other type of lettuce, an iceberg salad or some prepacked salad. But, I was cheap.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say with this is... Bringo is objectively superior to foodpanda. They have a way bigger library of products, they're more organized, you pay after the shopping, not before and having to wait days/weeks to get refunded (if you get, that is).</p>
<p>Why I made this post is because I'm quite bummed because of the lettuce, I'm sure kaufland had some other lettuce laying around, after all it's the best supermarket in Romania (personal opinion). I'm sure they had some prepacked salads, some iceberg salads, some romaine lettuce, some whatever. And if foodpanda had the policy of calling instead of not giving a damn, I would've had lettuce to enjoy today and tomorrow with the <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/chamchi-jjigae">tuna stew</a> I made today.</p>
<p>But... now I don't. Will it be worth the extra work tomorrow to go out of the house, walk 15 minutes (one way) to buy some lettuce? Absolutely, not, thankfully they had the valeriana (lamb's lettuce) I ordered, it's good enough.</p>
<p>As I said, I'm not sponsored, everything here is personal opinion. That's all there is to it, have a good night, see ya!</p> </article>
