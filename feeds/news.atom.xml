&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make a blog, so I made it.
I'll put food reviews, cooking, coding, ceramics, and whatever I feel the need to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make my own tea cups and so, I'd like to put them all here one day.
The aestetic I'm going towards is wabi-sabi, all my cups need a touch of irregularity, imperfection and rawness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently rent a place with some people and have our own workshop.
But later in life I want to have my own place to enjoy creating beauties to no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I might open an online shop for cups, but that remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work as a Software Engineer so there'll be a category dedicated to coding and stuff, depends if I find anything interesting enough to write and nobody has already written about it, because coding blogs are quite a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing it in English because I like English, and it offers the possibility for the hundreds of thousands of people awaiting to read my blog to actually be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's about it, see ya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit 12.08.2023: I actually currently co-own a pottery studio, but haven't updated the blog in quite a while, maybe will never do so. We'll see. No site tho.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category><category term="about"></category><category term="news"></category></entry></feed>
