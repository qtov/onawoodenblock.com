And why do a lot of programmers talk about it?
There are a ton of articles as to why Vim is indispensable, but I'm gonna tell it to you simple and easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;emsp;I don't use vim, I don't like vim. Vim is hard and it takes too much to make it how I want.
I also use Windows mostly, so I find any vim implementation to have a slow startup and if I want to use the terminal it's sometimes buggy (looking at you cmd).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;emsp;That's why I use is Sublime Text with the NeoVintageous plugin.
I get the rich plugin ecosystem of sublime, with the advantage of vim (in 99% of cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does vim work? Well, vim has a thing called modes.&lt;br&gt;
When you start the editor you're put in "normal" mode.&lt;br&gt;
You press &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; and you're put in "insert" mode where you... well... insert.&lt;br&gt;
To leave insert mode, you press &lt;code&gt;escape&lt;/code&gt;, and you'll be put you back in "normal" mode.&lt;br&gt;
You press &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ctrl+v&lt;/code&gt; and you're put in "visual" mode. With visual mode, you select without using your mouse.&lt;br&gt;
You press &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; to enter command-line mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to select 5 lines &lt;code&gt;V5j&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Imagine you want to select upwards without losing what you've already selected &lt;code&gt;o5k&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;emsp;The main point of vim is... stop using your mouse, it's a pain in the ass to move from keyboard to mouse to keyboard to mouse again and again when everything is so easy to do without the mouse.&lt;br&gt;
Also, why would you ever want to be in "insert" mode all the time, you lose so many possibilities for movement if you're 24/7 in insert mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;emsp;Traditional text editors work like this, they start in "insert" mode and then you have only a limited number of possible movements.&lt;br&gt;
You can move with the mouse, select with the mouse and drag and drop (not like anyone uses that... right?).&lt;br&gt;
Then you have the arrow keys, end/home, page up/page down, ctrl+arrow keys (in some editors even alt+arrow keys), and that's all.&lt;br&gt;
And if you want to select, use those movements while holding shift, which is quite painful from time to time. You can of course, select with mouse. With vim, you just enter insert mode and use all the movement keys like you'd do normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;emsp;But what if I told you, that you can use vim in any, or better said in most of the modern editors.&lt;br&gt;
Most of them will already have a plugin that emulates or even integrates neovim (vim rewritten by other people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every key in normal mode does a different thing. For example, if you want to move left down up right you use h j k l. You can also use arrow keys, nobody stops you.&lt;br&gt;
To enter insert mode, as I said, there are at least 6 keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; inserts a new line below and puts you into insert mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; inserts a new line above and puts you into insert mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; starts insert mode before the cursor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; starts insert mode after the cursor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; stars insert mode at the beginning of the line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; starts insert mode at the end of the line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;emsp;Vim also makes those keys easy to remember. And once your get over your initial fear of learning vim, you won't be able to live without it, seriously.&lt;br&gt;
Vim does commands, and those commands are easy to compose.&lt;br&gt;
To delete one line you use &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;, what if you want to delete 5 lines? &lt;code&gt;5dd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What if you want to delete 5 lines downwards &lt;code&gt;5dd&lt;/code&gt; (same as &lt;code&gt;5dd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;d4j&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
What about upwards &lt;code&gt;d4k&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;4dk&lt;/code&gt; (4 is not a mistake, I'll explain). Those commands translate to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; means delete whole line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;&amp;lt;command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;5dd&lt;/code&gt;) means repeat the command 5 times. Aka, delete 5 lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is the prefix for a command, that's why when you just press &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; in normal mode, it doesn't do anything until you press another key (or &lt;code&gt;escape&lt;/code&gt; to cancel). If you press &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; in visual mode when you have already selected something, that will simply delete the selected text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;d4j&lt;/code&gt; now, why 4? Well, when you do &lt;code&gt;dj&lt;/code&gt; it deletes the current line AND the line below. It literally translates to "delete" this line and the line below (for &lt;code&gt;d4j&lt;/code&gt; it's this line and the 4 lines below). If you do &lt;code&gt;4j&lt;/code&gt; it'll move you 4 lines below, exactly where all of those lines would be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of h j k l you can use arrow keys, but it's easier to have your hands on hjkl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now... I lied, &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; doesn't delete, but it's easy to remember it as &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;elete. It actually cuts text, and it puts it in the "unnamed register". Now, I won't talk about registers because the extensions usually use the system clipboard which is the best usecase in my opinion. You can paste in vim with &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; (paste after cursor)/&lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; (paste before cursor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can move not just letters, but words as well.&lt;br&gt;
For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; jump to the start of the next word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; jump to the start of the next word (ignore punctuation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; jump to the end of the words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; jump to the end of the words (ignore punctuation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; jump to the beginning of the words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; jump to the beginning of the words (ignore punctuation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also move by paragraphs &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;, move to matching paranthesis/brackets &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;elete, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;ank (copy), &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;hange (same as delete but puts you in insert mode afterwards), using the movement commands. &lt;code&gt;d5w&lt;/code&gt; (delete 5 words), &lt;code&gt;d5b&lt;/code&gt; (delete 5 words backwards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my favourite thing in vim, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;n and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;round.&lt;br&gt;
Assume you have a &lt;code&gt;function foo(var_a, var_b, var_c)&lt;/code&gt; and your cursor is on &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;var_b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
You want to get rid of all parameters and rewrite them &lt;code&gt;ci(&lt;/code&gt;, which translates to "change in  ()", what if I want to also delete the paranthesis? &lt;code&gt;ca(&lt;/code&gt; "change around ()".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the word &lt;code&gt;very_long_word_holy_guacamole&lt;/code&gt;, and I my cursor is on &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;word&lt;/code&gt;. Without vim I'd do &lt;code&gt;ctrl+right ctrl+backspace&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ctrl+right shift+ctrl+left delete/backspace&lt;/code&gt;, with vim I do &lt;code&gt;ciw&lt;/code&gt; "change in word".&lt;br&gt;
Every movement command can be used in combination with &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;elete, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;ank, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;hange, &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;isual, etc. Every command can be combined with the movement keys.
Now then, all of those were written from memory, it's easy to remember the commands once you use them, and it's a heck of a lot of fun doing so.&lt;br&gt;
There's also &lt;code&gt;ctrl+o&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ctrl+i&lt;/code&gt; to move to last cursor position and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is, vim is superior to the traditional way of editing text (aka only "insert" mode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you entered vim and can't exit it, you can exit it from normal mode or command mode.&lt;br&gt;
The traditional way is in normal mode you press &lt;code&gt;:q&lt;/code&gt; and enter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; stands for command-line mode, &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; stands for quit. Also &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; stands for write, so if you want to save and exit &lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;:x&lt;/code&gt; (x is a bit different though, it won't write if no change occured).&lt;br&gt;
If you want to quit without saving &lt;code&gt;:q!&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Now you can also quit or save without pressing &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;ZZ&lt;/code&gt; (equivalent to &lt;code&gt;:x&lt;/code&gt;) or &lt;code&gt;ZQ&lt;/code&gt; (equivalent to &lt;code&gt;:q!&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you want to learn it, there's a good unix command (once you installed vim) called &lt;code&gt;vimtutor&lt;/code&gt;. It's there in wsl or any unix based operating system, might even be on windows if you install gvim.&lt;br&gt;
If you don't want to learn it &lt;code&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tech"></category><category term="editor"></category><category term="vim"></category><category term="sublime"></category></entry><entry><title>I love cracks.</title><link href="https://onawoodenblock.com/i-love-cracks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-30T00:03:00+03:00</published><updated>2021-04-30T00:03:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Rexu</name></author><id>tag:onawoodenblock.com,2021-04-30:/i-love-cracks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Waterglass and Iron Oxide, quick showoff.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, throughout my adventures with clay, I started playing with waterglass.&lt;br&gt;
I go to a workshop for ceramics and the person in charge, Andras, told me about it.&lt;br&gt;
So, I gave it a test round, came out quite great, and so I decided to make myself a chawan with the accumulated knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love iron oxide (rust), I feel like it adds to the aestetique of age.&lt;br&gt;
I'm deeply, let me repeat myself, deeply in love with the philosophy and aestetique of wabi-sabi, and that's the style I pursue in my cups.&lt;br&gt;
I want them to feel raw, imperfect, not too complicated, not too simple. Fortunately, I haven't yet found it, I'm still in the pursuit of it, and I'm saying fortunately because the journey towards the perfect style is a heck of a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then, short intro, here are the cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First try, to see what can iron oxide and waterglass do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/waterglass_test.jpg" width="760"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the second cup. After seeing what I can do with it, this is one of the works I'm proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/chawan_waterglass.jpg" width="760"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, looking for ceramic workshops in Cluj. Somehow, I find one and I muster up my courage to go for a visit.&lt;br&gt;
I put myself on a chair and the guy in charge (we'll call him A) starts explaning about everything and guides me through every step in making a beautiful teacup.&lt;br&gt;
He tells me to start with a technique called "nerikomi", make a salami combining clays, then cut pieces, put them side by side to form a rectangle and then press it into a predefined form. Pressing it into a "biscuit" ceramic bowl is the easiest way of achieving a form. It's fired at 800-1000 degrees celsius and it absorbs moisture, so once I put in into form, it can easily separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's what I do, I'm given multiple clays with similar shrinkage. Clay shrinks after moisture evaporates and if you make nerikomi and the shrinkage is too different, it will separate either when drying or biscuiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make a rectangle using white, brown and some black, and start pressing it into form, being VERY careful not to break anything. Afterwards I put a little circle foot on the bottom of the cup and with that three hours have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I await the next workshop which is two weeks later. The workshop used to be held twice a month before transitioning to twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next workshop comes, I carefully sandpaper the cup and make the form of another cup (which I probably won't talk about, didn't come out that great).&lt;br&gt;
And so, another two weeks pass, my cup was fired at 850&amp;deg;C and now it's time to glaze it. Because it's my very first cup and I want to see the pattern so I use a transparent glaze.&lt;br&gt;
Another two weeks, my cup is fired at 1200&amp;deg;C and it's finally ready. I can take it home and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the story, it took quite a while to finish the cup, and I put at least 5 hours in.&lt;/p&gt;

My mom told me those things, and the only tea we'd ever drink was mint tea with a ton of lemon and honey. Nowadays, thinking back, it was kind of a hot lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I used to watch TV with my dad and from time to time there would be some Chinese movie where they'd drink tea. I liked the idea and look of it, but never put more thought into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in highschool I watched an anime called &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/4898/Kuroshitsuji"&gt;Kuroshitsuji&lt;/a&gt; and there was a scene where the master asks for tea from his butler, but not any tea, it was Earl Grey.&lt;br&gt;
The butler goes in the basement, brings the tea and makes him a cup. Mind you, I have NEVER heard even once, the name of the tea. I never had any tangency with the subject of tea except from what I wrote above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled, I have to try this I thought... But can I even find it in Romania? And how expensive such a thing can be? The name is posh af.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the not so distant future, I went to Kaufland with my mom in search of Earl Grey, it doesn't hurt to give it a shot, might actually find it in the supermarket.&lt;br&gt;
Found the tea section and there it was... &lt;a href="/images/dukat_earl_grey.webp"&gt;Dukat Earl Grey&lt;/a&gt; teabags, 2-3 ron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?! So cheap? I was both happy and scared, overly cheap things surely compromise a lot on quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went home and was still excited to try it. My mom told me to be careful because it's bitter.&lt;br&gt;
Of course that didn't stop me.
I boiled some water, put the teabag and waited 3 minutes (that's what was written on the box).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the long awaited time, I gave it a sip. Wasn't anything spectacular, a tad bit bitter, not too much taste.&lt;br&gt;
What if I add some sugar? I put 1-2 teaspoons of sugar and tried it again... WOAH! Fell in love with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months pass, I become increasingly more into tea (with sugar) and buy almost every type of tea from the supermarkets to try it out.&lt;br&gt;
Lipton, Twinnings, Dukat, Taylors of Harrogate and all those big/little brands, I've tried quite a number, I liked them. I tried senchas, Earl Grey, Lady Grey, Breakfast Tea, gunpowder, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the 12th grade (last year of highschool) I met somebody on the internet, on a site for anime quotes. He was looking for people to help with the coding of the site. php, HTML and CSS, the things I had to learn that year. I thought it would be a good learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking/playing/coding for a few months with him, we became good friends, and I found out that he drinks tea as well, but only thyme tea.&lt;br&gt;
In the past I used to want to like the things the people I looked up to liked. And because I looked up to this person, tea became an even more important part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highschool ends and here comes university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reach a time where I drink a few cups per day while working on projects and staying in front of my laptop.&lt;br&gt;
I think to myself, I love tea, but if I have each cup with one to two teaspoons of sugar per day, it won't do well for me later on. So I completely remove the sugar, and surprisingly, I enjoy it. I grew to yearn for the bitter flavors of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey of collecting and trying out new teas does not stop. Months pass, I have a full cabinet worth of teas. Mostly teabags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanting to learn more about the types of tea and how they are made, I stumble on a Youtube channel called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaHBABJFMRAtnKhQp2Cu5BQ"&gt;Meileaf&lt;/a&gt;, and on their video called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUuw5rqWkZU"&gt;The 6 Types Of Tea&lt;/a&gt;. I watch more of their videos and find out about a thing called "Gong Fu Tea", and I want to try it very much. They also have made me become a purist, back then &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fZclzJUhYg"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; didn't exist, but it's exactly the message I got from a lot of their videos.&lt;br&gt;
It was around that time that my girlfriend moved from Hungary to Romania to live with me and started working at Demmers in Cluj.&lt;br&gt;
Because of Demmers I had the chance to try good loose leaf tea, and not the prepackaged, stale, old (not in a good way) teas from supermarkets. For that, I thank them.&lt;br&gt;
From them also, I bought my first gaiwan, a simple white porcelain, and so I had the chance to try gong-fu, from that moment on Western style tea disappeared from my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not enough, I wanted more. What if Demmers is not the gold standard of teas, what if there are better teas out there? I can't just blindly accept that I have found the end of my tea journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately it was not the end, &lt;a href="https://white2tea.com/"&gt;white2tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://yunnansourcing.com/"&gt;Yunnan Sourcing&lt;/a&gt; (when they used to ship to Romania, last time I looked they didn't anymore), &lt;a href="https://nioteas.com/"&gt;NioTeas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hibiki-an.com/"&gt;Hibiki-an&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://eco-cha.com/"&gt;eco-cha&lt;/a&gt; and the list goes on and on.&lt;br&gt;
Don't get me wrong though, Demmers doesn't have bad teas. They're affordable and you can find them in Cluj. And if your life doesn't depend on tea, they're a very good choice.&lt;br&gt;
But if you're like me and life literally revolves around tea, it's not the end goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good book that thought me a lot about teas was &lt;a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Tea-Kevin-Gascoyne/9780228100270"&gt;Tea: History, Terroirs, Varieties&lt;/a&gt;. I also linked my favourite site to buy books from, free worldwide delivery, they're a life saver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my journey has not ended, I have to personally go to those countries, and try the teas, brewed in their local spring waters, freshly picked, freshly roasted, take part of the process, learn more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because tea was such an important thing in my life, I started collecting teaware, gaiwans, cups, teapots.&lt;br&gt;
So, one day, I was looking for movies/series/anime about tea, and I found it: &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/9996/Hyouge_Mono"&gt;Hyouge Mono&lt;/a&gt;. It's an anime with tea, but the main focus is teaware. I was thrilled by how they described teaware.&lt;br&gt;
What if... I make my own? I have a profound connection with tea, why shouldn't I share the connection with teaware?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, after a few weeks of looking, researching, I found a ceramic workshop in Cluj. I gathered my courage and paid a visit. I instantly became a regular.&lt;br&gt;
My first cup (I'll talk about it in a later post) was a success in my opinion, and so I made cups over cups over cups. With that, I've found my purpose in life.&lt;br&gt;
That after I die, I leave a few pieces of teaware that somebody will put his hands on and say "that's beautiful".
That's what I want to leave behind, beauty in the form of a teacup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I can go to the workshop only once a week, and now because of some works around the area I can't go until the end of August. That is way too little, it's not remotely enough to even have dreams, yet alone, achieve them. I want to spend tens of years, hours a day, practicing. That's the only way it can ever be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, the end goal is, a studio of my own where I can spend hours a day, and a kiln. And who knows, probably a teashop where people can enjoy drinking from my cups.&lt;br&gt;
It will take quite a few years to achieve my dream, but it's a clear path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month it used to be free delivery so I have a little bit of experience with them.&lt;br&gt;
My 3 packs of "PARBOILED" long grain rice became simple long grain rice, things that don't exist, don't exist, and they won't even tell you that, you can't buy less than 1kg of meat or any other vegetable (why? because there's not way to select or even write in any note).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, because I was cheap, because it was 11 ron cheaper than Bringo (and I didn't want to spend more than 100 ron, whereas when I order bringo at least 50 ron is spent on promotions if I don't want to pay the delivery fee), I was like, they can't fuck it up today as well, can they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They didn't, fortunately, but the SPECIFIC items that don't exist, don't exist. I'm left without my salad and spring onions... sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ordered through Bringo they would've nicely called me and said "Hey mate, we don't have spring onions and lettuce" and then they would've told me what they replaced them with and ask me if I want any more replacements or if I'm ok with what they did.&lt;br&gt;
I could've replaced my spring onions with a leek and that exact lettuce with some other type of lettuce, an iceberg salad or some prepacked salad. But, I was cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm trying to say with this is... Bringo is objectively superior to foodpanda. They have a way bigger library of products, they're more organized, you pay after the shopping, not before and having to wait days/weeks to get refunded (if you get, that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I made this post is because I'm quite bummed because of the lettuce, I'm sure kaufland had some other lettuce laying around, after all it's the best supermarket in Romania (personal opinion). I'm sure they had some prepacked salads, some iceberg salads, some romaine lettuce, some whatever. And if foodpanda had the policy of calling instead of not giving a damn, I would've had lettuce to enjoy today and tomorrow with the &lt;a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/chamchi-jjigae"&gt;tuna stew&lt;/a&gt; I made today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... now I don't. Will it be worth the extra work tomorrow to go out of the house, walk 15 minutes (one way) to buy some lettuce? Absolutely, not, thankfully they had the valeriana (lamb's lettuce) I ordered, it's good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all there is to it, have a good night!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Food"></category><category term="food"></category><category term="order"></category></entry><entry><title>Sushi Factory</title><link href="https://onawoodenblock.com/sushi-factory.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-03T23:49:00+03:00</published><updated>2021-04-03T23:49:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Rexu</name></author><id>tag:onawoodenblock.com,2021-04-03:/sushi-factory.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sushi Factory 50% off&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So... I ordered yesterday some sushi from Sushi Factory through Tazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought emag genius a while ago when they gave a 50 ron voucher when you bought it, and I was like... I'll surely save 50 extra ron through orders and all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I did, quite fast apparently, and now they also make it free delivery from restaurants if the order is over 75 ron. And because I live with my gf we usually order 75 ron worth of food for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a sponsor btw, not like anybody even reads it to sponsor, lol, but I think it's quite a good alternative compared to the HipMenu killer, foodpanda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I bought sushi from &lt;a href="https://tazz.ro/cluj-napoca/sushi-factory/5165/partener"&gt;Sushi Factory&lt;/a&gt; and it was 50% off. What I took were...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XL Rolls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XL salmon - 8 pcs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XL karage - 8 pcs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XL shrimp katsu - 8 pcs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XL California - 8 pcs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XL tuna - 8 pcs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maki:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maki Surimi - 6 pcs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maki Salmon - 6 pcs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point is, I paid 78.5 ron excluding tips for around as much as I would've eaten at Wasabi (the all you can eat sushi in Iulius) and I even had leftovers the next day.
Ofc I wasn't alone, but I ate 6 pieces from each of the XL rolls and 4 from each of the makis. And I was happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's either because I haven't eaten sushi in such a long time, but damn it was really great. It's definitely worth when it's half price off, when it's full price... eh, not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to go at Wasabi, I would've had to pay for two tickets, which is way more than I want to spend. But I definitely would've made my money worth there, I'm a vacuum cleaner. I became a vacuum cleaner through hard work, eating one meal a day and fitting everything I need for the day in one sitting. An all you can eat buffet is perfect for getting my daily (or even for the next 3 days) worth of calories, the rest of the days, I can fast. Talk about efficiency, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I just wanted to let you know that sushi factory is 50% off, and it's definitely worth it, I'm still craving for more (also, hopefully you have some soy sauce, cause I needed extra, and pickled ginger as well).&lt;/p&gt;

It's great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all, see ya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright alright, how do you make kimchi. I'm by no means a chef or anything, but I like kimchi. And if I want to buy it from my local asian store... it's HELLISHLY expesive. Imagine 30-35 ron for 200-300g of kimchi. Where when I make my own, 20 ron max for around 3kg. Also, mine is way better, I'm serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a shit ton of kimchi recipes around the internet but I'll share with you my take on it and the experiences I've had with it. I usually skip sugar or any "empty" carbs when I cook. That's why never make a rice flour porridge for it, but you can definitely take that approach! For the rice flour alternative, &lt;a href="https://www.maangchi.com/"&gt;Maangchi&lt;/a&gt; has a good &lt;a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/easy-kimchi"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first kimchi recipe I tried (and the one I am mostly going with) was from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChBEbMKI1eCcejTtmI32UEw"&gt;Joshua Weismann&lt;/a&gt; and it was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXhJcdXPyYI"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. The recipe is also on his blog (&lt;a href="https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/kimchi"&gt;https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/kimchi&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can easily be substituted in his recipe are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;daikon radishes (aka white radish) for black radish (cut them thin though, they have a special spiciness to them) or even simple radish (cut it thin as well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asian pear for an apple or normal pear, lol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sometimes when you really can't find spring onions... leek also works. Spring onions though strictly superior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what you can add are yellow onions, they work very well in the sauce.
For grams, look at the blog post of Joshua Weismann, it's a good starting point, you don't have to be too accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually my choice of ingredients are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napa Cabbage: 2 big pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iodine Free Salt: enough, you'll see later on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrots: 2 medium/big pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black radish: 1 piece, or half of a big white radish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green onions: around 6-7 medium pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apple: 1 medium/large&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yellow onion: 1 medium, can be skipped, but it's better with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;garlic: ~30g-50g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ginger: ~70g-80g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fish sauce: ~100ml-120ml&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;korean red pepper flakes: ~80g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly important to have good pepper flakes that taste good, not just seeds that are JUST spicy. It also helps with the color, the beautiful red color can't be achieved with seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be skipped in my opinion are the carrots and the radishes, but the kimchi will be WAY sadder. The crunch of the radish and carrots simply make life worth living. So, try to get at least one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well then, how do you make kimchi. I highly suggest watching Joshua Weismann's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXhJcdXPyYI"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; and making his, and then if you want extra steps, here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a first try, I suggest cutting the cabbage as shown in the video, &lt;a href="images/kimchi_bite_size.jpg"&gt;bite size pieces&lt;/a&gt;, it'll be easier.
Shove them in a bowl and salt them heavily, think oversalted, and add a bit more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the cabbage sit for around 1 hour, 2 hours even, or 30 minutes if you're too hurried.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Until then, prepare the other vegetables, cut things in strips, if they're too thin you won't feel a bite to them. I usually do something like &lt;a href="images/cut_names.jpg"&gt;batonnet&lt;/a&gt;. If you're using black radish, cut it to fine julliene, or if you enjoy the taste, bigger. The veggies of one of my batches were cut like &lt;a href="images/kimchi_pieces.jpg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shove the ingredients for the paste in a food processor and make the paste. If the ingredients are too dry and not mixing well/paste is too thick, add more fish sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the cabbage soaked for 1 hour or however much you decided to let it, wash it thoroughly under running water to wash all the excess salt. The amount of salt that we need is already absorbed in the cabbage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine everything and put in a glass jar, or plastic box (food safe and BPA free) and push it down so to pack it tightly, not overly violent. Cover with lid, not fully, if the bacteria needs to fart, let the farts escape. You can also close the lid fully, but be careful of pressure building up. You'll close the lid fully (airtight) only when putting it in the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can of course eat some of the kimchi right away. Let the rest stay happily outside at room temperature to ferment for around 3-4 days (taste at 3rd day and see if you like the amount of acidity) and then let it rest in the fridge for around a week and you'll have the best kimchi possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long does it stay in the fridge? I'd say definitely at least 6 months. I had only one kimchi that lasted 6 months, because it was an enormous amount for a single person to eat. It does become more acidic with time, because it ferments more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do with the kimchi? I usually eat from it when making rice bowls, stir-fry and when I need an acidic companion to some dishes like french fries, jajangmyeon, dumplings.
It goes on almost everything, it's seriously delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does fermentation work? We'll explore that some other time, I have to talk about it quite a bit, I'm in love with it. But I can't ever explain it better than the book &lt;a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Art-Fermentation-Sandor-Ellix-Katz/9781603582865"&gt;The Art of Fermentation by Sandor Katz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's my take on kimchi, it's worth trying it at least once in your life, I fell in love instantly (I usually fall in love with fermented foods, so it's not new). If you want something easier, I'd suggest sauerkraut (salt, cabbage and patience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around one year ago (3rd of April 2020) I made a batch of kimchi, and I apparently took pictures. The color came out something like &lt;a href="images/kimchi_me1.jpg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, that's what you're aiming for. The most recent batch looks something like &lt;a href="images/kimchi_me2.jpg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, yeah... that's it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Food"></category><category term="food"></category><category term="fermentation"></category><category term="recipe"></category></entry><entry><title>Most dissapointing order of my life</title><link href="https://onawoodenblock.com/most-dissapointing-order-of-my-life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-28T23:48:00+03:00</published><updated>2021-03-28T23:48:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Rexu</name></author><id>tag:onawoodenblock.com,2021-03-28:/most-dissapointing-order-of-my-life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Depressing garlic sauce (mujdeiul trist)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I put once, two years ago an order for some food at Casa Vikingilor, it was at that time when you had to pay quite a big delivery fee, I think from HipMenu.
Food arrives, I'm excited, I take out my sauerkraut, my meat and my mujdei (garlic sauce usually made with water, garlic, salt, but sometimes added some milk, heavy cream, or tomatoes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put some of the meat in mujdei and take a bite... something's bitter. Take a bite without mujdei, it tastes like meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only thing that can taste bad is mujdei, but how can mujdei taste bad? let's take a sip, shall we? hm... how can I describe the taste... warm bitter milk water, yup, that's it.
I mean, imagine, take a little vessel, add warm water, put a drop of milk, add some drop of random bitterness (no trace of garlic btw) and mix.
This is what they charged me 5 ron for... Warm bitter water with milk. Seriously... I didn't have garlic in my house cause I could've made it faster and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it went directly in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add wood on fire, the meat was stringy af, the pork or whatever it was could've won the title for the oldest living mammal.
And the sauerkraut, it was ok, nothing to complain about that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point is, when someone can't even make a mujdei properly, then I know the restaurant is worth shit, like come on, how freaking hard can it be? And can't you even taste to see that it tastes like piss? C'mon...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so this was it, disappointment, paid a shitton for delivery (10-15 ron), 5 ron went to trash, 5 ron tip for delivery guy and sadness. Loss of money, I have been avoiding them ever since, I'm scared of throwing food, I don't like throwing food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it could be a one-time mistake, but for me the eye boggling fact that you CAN make bad mujdei still haunts me. Seriously... garlic, salt, water... simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Food"></category><category term="food"></category><category term="order"></category></entry><entry><title>KFC, bones and Tom Yum</title><link href="https://onawoodenblock.com/kfc-bones-and-tom-yum.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-28T23:10:00+03:00</published><updated>2021-03-28T23:10:00+03:00</updated><author><name>Rexu</name></author><id>tag:onawoodenblock.com,2021-03-28:/kfc-bones-and-tom-yum.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ordered KFC, made some Tom Yum soup with the bones.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So... Friday I had a strong desire for KFC. I went on foodpanda (cause Tazz doesn't have it) and looked to see which can get me the best deal for my money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80 ron for Giant Bucket, ~670g of meat, ~480g of potatoes. eh... potatoes are cheap, I can fry myself, I have around 2-3kgs of fresh potatoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47.5 ron for American Bucket, ~550g of meat (11 crispy, 11 wings).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36.5 ron for Hot Bucket, ~400g of meat (20 wings).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Bucket is the best choice, 0.086 ron for gram of meat, compared to Hot Bucket which is 0.091 ron for gram of meat (and all of them are wings, so I'd pay for bones as well). I'm a cheap person, I usually buy only when heavily discounted, I can barely afford to order once a week, so better make the best out of it, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I bought 2 American Buckets, I need meat, I don't want to pay transport fees twice. I put the order, and I instantly started preparing the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dklh4oKifVQ"&gt;french fries&lt;/a&gt;.
10 minutes boil in water with vinegar, take them out, shove them in my wok with oil, and fry them ONCE, nobody has the time to fry them twice when the bucket is on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Came out crispy af, better than kfc can ever make. Chicken was ok, but soggy, nothing to expect from kfc delivery. It steams in there for a while, and until the driver arrives it can take its sweet time in that sauna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was satisfied nonetheless. With a lot of meat, comes a lot of bones, should I simply throw them away?
Absolutely not, put them in a pot with water and simmer that for around 1 hour, until I got bored and let it cool. Put it in a container and in the fridge it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today (Sunday) I remembered I have that stock in the fridge, took it out, put it in a pot, brought it to boil, put a big spoon of Tom Yum paste (which you can find at TasteOfAsia or &lt;a href="https://iwok.ro/produs/pasta-iute-acrisoara-tom-yum-thai-454-g/"&gt;iwok&lt;/a&gt;).
Made some noodles, blanched some kale (had some from ColinaFarms), boiled some eggs, cut some green onions, done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed an easy soup without too much hassle. I really recommend something like that, it's a paste that stays in the fridge for months (mine is in the fridge for over 16 months). I haven't died yet, had no problems, has a shit ton of salt so it's preserved quite well. Also, IF you ever make such a soup or ramen, I definitely recommend blanching some leafy greens like kale, spinach or lettuce, it definitely adds a lot of texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sidenote, what I also ate today was some chicken in the oven with some herb mix and a side of butter sauteed kale. Nothing too fancy, but it did its job. The bones were put in the fridge to make tomorrow another chicken stock, I'm not wasting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as to why I put Colinafarms if I'm such a cheap person? I make questionable choices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Food"></category><category term="food"></category><category term="order"></category></entry><entry><title>First order Colinafarms</title><link href="https://onawoodenblock.com/first-order-colinafarms.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-24T20:21:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-03-24T20:21:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Rexu</name></author><id>tag:onawoodenblock.com,2021-03-24:/first-order-colinafarms.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My very first order from colinafarms&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, after hearing a lot about &lt;a href="https://colinafarms.ro/"&gt;colinafarms&lt;/a&gt; and their weekly (or bi-monthly) crate, I was like... I love crates and surprises, why the heck not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put an order for 75 ron every two weeks kind of package and today I received my very first package.
What I got was 1kg of potatoes, 2 pcs celeriac, 4 packs of kale, 100g of rucola, 1 pack of spring onions, 1 piece green salad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed it does feel quite expensive, 75 ron for this much, BUT! it's good.
Like, you can feel the taste of the green onions depending on where you buy them from. When I ordered from Bringo (Carrefour) some green onions they had quite an unpleasant taste, and it wasn't a one-time pot of bad luck, but it became a habit.
Those spring onions from colina remind me of the onions that my grandma grew, they're delicious. Anyways, I cut the stems and shoved them in a box with dirt, I'll grow some on my own as well, cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filled myself a bowl of leaves and I munched on them like a rabbit, I feel like the green salad and rucola work with anything. One bite of food, a mouthful of leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I plan on making some &lt;a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/chamchi-jjigae"&gt;chamchi jjigae (spicy tuna stew)&lt;/a&gt; and some rice, pack everything in some of the leaves and enjoy the hell out of it. I might blanch the kale, because it's quite hard, but I don't think the green salad needs any blanching. The stew is very easy to make, but you'll need gochujang (some sweet spicy chilli paste), which can be found at TasteOfAsia (Cluj) or &lt;a href="https://iwok.ro/produs/pasta-de-ardei-iute-coreeana-gochujang-sempio-500/"&gt;iwok.ro&lt;/a&gt;. You might find other shops, better price, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all in all, is it worth it? 75 ron for around 30 ron worth of veggies (non-bio, normal)? Eh.
If you've got the money, definitely! They came to me green and lively, unlike the ones I find in the supermarket, lacking of life. Also, to mention, I'm not going to the market cause I don't really leave my house, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll update more if I think there's any need to do so, until then, see ya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: I made a pic of the salad and the stew

&lt;p&gt;I live in Cluj-Napoca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make a blog, so I made it.
I'll put food reviews (mostly orders, cause I don't really leave my house), cooking, coding, ceramics, and whatever I feel the need to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dream is, making cups, literally. I aim high.
I actually make my own tea cups and so, I'd like to put them all here one day.
The aestetic I'm going towards is wabi-sabi, all my cups need a touch of irregularity, imperfection and rawness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't own a kiln or studio yet, I'm just visiting a workshop once a week maximum, and now I won't be able to until August because of some works in the area.
But I do want and will have a kiln and a place to enjoy creating beauties to no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I might open an online shop for cups, but that remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work as a Software Engineer so there'll be a category dedicated to coding and stuff, depends if I find anything interesting enough to write and nobody has already written about it, because coding blogs are quite a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing it in English because I like English, and it offers the possibility for the hundreds of thousands of people awaiting to read my blog to actually be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's about it, see ya!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category><category term="about"></category><category term="news"></category></entry></feed>
