</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So, I put once, two years ago an order for some food at Casa Vikingilor, it was at that time when you had to pay quite a big delivery fee, I think from HipMenu.
Food arrives, I'm excited, I take out my sauerkraut, my meat and my mujdei (garlic sauce usually made with water, garlic, salt, but sometimes added some milk, heavy cream, or tomatoes).</p>
<p>Put some of the meat in mujdei and take a bite... something's bitter. Take a bite without mujdei, it tastes like meat.</p>
<p>Only thing that can taste bad is mujdei, but how can mujdei taste bad? let's take a sip, shall we? hm... how can I describe the taste... warm bitter milk water, yup, that's it.
I mean, imagine, take a little vessel, add warm water, put a drop of milk, add some drop of random bitterness (no trace of garlic btw) and mix.
This is what they charged me 5 ron for... Warm bitter water with milk. Seriously... I didn't have garlic in my house cause I could've made it faster and cheaper.</p>
<p>Anyways, it went directly in the toilet.</p>
<p>To add wood on fire, the meat was stringy af, the pork or whatever it was could've won the title for the oldest living mammal.
And the sauerkraut, it was ok, nothing to complain about that one.</p>
<p>Point is, when someone can't even make a mujdei properly, then I know the restaurant is worth shit, like come on, how freaking hard can it be? And can't you even taste to see that it tastes like piss? C'mon...</p>
<p>Yeah, so this was it, disappointment, paid a shitton for delivery (10-15 ron), 5 ron went to trash, 5 ron tip for delivery guy and sadness. Loss of money, I have been avoiding them ever since, I'm scared of throwing food, I don't like throwing food.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be a one-time mistake, but for me the eye boggling fact that you CAN make bad mujdei still haunts me. Seriously... garlic, salt, water... simple.</p>
<p>Well yeah... see ya!</p>
