Summary: Sushi Factory 50% off

So... I ordered yesterday some sushi from Sushi Factory through Tazz.

I bought emag genius a while ago when they gave a 50 ron voucher when you bought it, and I was like... I'll surely save 50 extra ron through orders and all that.

And I did, quite fast apparently, and now they also make it free delivery from restaurants if the order is over 75 ron. And because I live with my gf we usually order 75 ron worth of food for both of us.

Not a sponsor btw, not like anybody even reads it to sponsor, lol, but I think it's quite a good alternative compared to the HipMenu killer, foodpanda.

Anyways, I bought sushi from [Sushi Factory](https://tazz.ro/cluj-napoca/sushi-factory/5165/partener) 50% off. What I took were...

XL Rolls:

- XL salmon - 8 pcs
- XL karage - 8 pcs
- XL shrimp katsu - 8 pcs
- XL California - 8 pcs
- XL tuna - 8 pcs

Maki:

- Maki Surimi - 6 pcs
- Maki Salmon - 6 pcs

Point is, I paid 78.5 ron excluding tips for around as much as I would've eaten at Wasabi (the all you can eat sushi in Iulius) and I even had leftovers the next day.
Ofc I wasn't alone, but I ate 6 pieces from each of the XL rolls and 4 from each of the makis. And I was happy.

It's either because I haven't eaten sushi in such a long time, but damn it was really great. It's definitely worth when it's half price off, when it's full price... eh, not for me.

If I wanted to go at Wasabi, I would've had to pay for two tickets, which is way more than I want to spend. But I definitely would've made my money worth there, I'm a vacuum cleaner. I became a vacuum cleaner through hard work, eating one meal a day and fitting everything I need for the day in one sitting. An all you can eat buffet is perfect for getting my daily (or even for the next 3 days) worth of calories, the rest of the days, I can fast. Talk about efficiency, lol.

Anyways, I just wanted to let you know that sushi factory is 50% off, and it's definitely worth it, I'm still craving for more (also, hopefully you have some soy sauce, cause I needed extra, and pickled ginger as well).

That's it then, see ya!
