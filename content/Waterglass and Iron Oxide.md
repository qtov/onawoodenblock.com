Summary: Waterglass and Iron Oxide, quick showoff.

So, throughout my adventures with clay, I started playing with waterglass.  
I go to a workshop for ceramics and the person in charge, Andras, told me about it.  
So, I gave it a test round, came out quite great, and so I decided to make myself a chawan with the accumulated knowledge.

I also love iron oxide (rust), I feel like it adds to the aestetique of age.  
I'm deeply, let me repeat myself, deeply in love with the philosophy and aestetique of wabi-sabi, and that's the style I pursue in my cups.  
I want them to feel raw, imperfect, not too complicated, not too simple. Fortunately, I haven't yet found it, I'm still in the pursuit of it, and I'm saying fortunately because the journey towards the perfect style is a heck of a lot of fun.

So then, short intro, here are the cups.

First try, to see what can iron oxide and waterglass do.

And here is the second. After seeing what I can do with it, this is one of the works I'm proud of.
