Summary: Short summary to what this blog is about.

Who am I? Nobody important.

I live in Cluj-Napoca (for now) and probably will move to Debrecen in the next couple of months. I'm not sure though, we'll see.

I wanted to make a blog, so yeah, this is it.
It'll contain food reviews (mostly orders, cause I don't really leave my house), cooking, coding, and whatever I feel the need to write about.

My hobbies are: cooking, food, tea, ceramics (I make), k-drama, anime, music, VERY casual gaming, +/- a few others.
I wish I'd add travelling, but I'm poor af, can't afford it for now, might be able to later on. I very much want to travel to Korea, Japan, China to try some asian street food, that's what life is for, asian street food.

Currently working in an IT position for 3 years (at the date of writing this).

I have a lot of bashing to do for some places in Cluj, so I'm doing this to immortalize the money loss that occured from ordering from them.

I'm writing it in English because I like English (not amazing at it, but life), and it offers the possibility for the hundreds of thousands of people awaiting to read my blog to actually be able to.

I hope you'll like it, see ya!
