Summary: Short summary to what this blog is about.

So, what is this blog about...

I wanted to make a blog, so I made it.
I'll put food reviews, cooking, coding, ceramics, and whatever I feel the need to write about.

I make my own tea cups and so, I'd like to put them all here one day.
The aestetic I'm going towards is wabi-sabi, all my cups need a touch of irregularity, imperfection and rawness.

I currently rent a place with some people and have our own workshop.
But later in life I want to have my own place to enjoy creating beauties to no end.

Later, I might open an online shop for cups, but that remains to be seen.

I work as a Software Engineer so there'll be a category dedicated to coding and stuff, depends if I find anything interesting enough to write and nobody has already written about it, because coding blogs are quite a few.

I'm writing it in English because I like English, and it offers the possibility for the hundreds of thousands of people awaiting to read my blog to actually be able to.

Well, that's about it, see ya!

Edit 12.08.2023: I actually currently co-own a pottery studio, but haven't updated the blog in quite a while, maybe will never do so. We'll see. No site tho.
